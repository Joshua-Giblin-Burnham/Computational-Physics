## Introduction
Repository for Ant optimisation code. 

The  analogous  behaviour  of  ant  colonies  as  cooperative,  algorithmic  agents  and  computational 
heuristic  algorithms  is  adapted  as  an  approach  to  solve  combinatorial  optimisation  problems.  An  ant  colony 
optimisation  algorithm  is  implemented  using  a  probabilistic  based  algorithm  for  solving  path  optimisation 
problems. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is used as the predominant paradigm and the 
main characteristics of this model are positive feedback and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic; positive 
feedback  allows  for  discovery  and  reinforcement  of  optimal  solutions,  and  the  greedy  heuristic  helps  find 
acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process.  We apply this methodology to both a simple, two 
path Minimal Spanning Tree Problem (MST) and the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We discuss 
the effectiveness of this implementation and explore parameter selection to optimise results.

## Running Simulator
The code can be used to solve a path optimisation problem, all in self contained jupyter notebooks. 


## Common errors:
- Package files not located in working directory or system path
- Some modules may require Python 3.9 or newer. 
- You must be careful to change path syntaax if using mac or linux.
